The human body reacts to both the proteins (A1 and A2) differently because A1 has an amino acid called histidine and A2 has an amino acid called proline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As compared to A1 milk, A2 milk is much easier to digest for people with weak digestion. The A1 protein creates a protein fragmentation during digestion, known as beta-casomorphin-7 or BCM-7, which leads to discomfort. Talking about A2 milk benefits, it doesn\u2019t contain BCM-7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A2 is the purest and unaltered type of organic milk produced. Produced by cows that have been reared with care and reverence. These cows are fed by fodder, greens, vegetables, jaggery and natural foods, clean water and kept in healthy conditions. No special solutions or medicines are given to them to alter their milk. No machines are used and the upkeep and milking process is traditional and in the Vedic way. Our cows give much less milk compared to European ones. That is why European cow A1 milk is easily and cheaply available. A2 &nbsp;milk has high demand but desi cow A2 milk dairies are limited as most dairies converted to European cow A1 milk as they produce almost 5 times more milk in a day compared to desi cows. It is believed that A2 milk is safe to consume for infants as well, who have very sensitive digestive systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The reason behind growing demand for A2 milk is that it is believed that A2 is the original and natural\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":798,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/797"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=797"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/797\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/798"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=797"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=797"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/familyfarmers.co.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=797"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
