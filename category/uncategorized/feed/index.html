										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The reason behind growing demand for A2 milk is that it is believed that A2 is the original and natural protein which existed in cow milk since the very beginning, and A1 protein came along much later as a mutation with the increase in demand for high quantity and quality milk. The human body reacts to both the proteins (A1 and A2) differently because A1 has an amino acid called histidine and A2 has an amino acid called proline.</p>



<p>As compared to A1 milk, A2 milk is much easier to digest for people with weak digestion. The A1 protein creates a protein fragmentation during digestion, known as beta-casomorphin-7 or BCM-7, which leads to discomfort. Talking about A2 milk benefits, it doesn’t contain BCM-7.</p>



<p>A2 is the purest and unaltered type of organic milk produced. Produced by cows that have been reared with care and reverence. These cows are fed by fodder, greens, vegetables, jaggery and natural foods, clean water and kept in healthy conditions. No special solutions or medicines are given to them to alter their milk. No machines are used and the upkeep and milking process is traditional and in the Vedic way. Our cows give much less milk compared to European ones. That is why European cow A1 milk is easily and cheaply available. A2 &nbsp;milk has high demand but desi cow A2 milk dairies are limited as most dairies converted to European cow A1 milk as they produce almost 5 times more milk in a day compared to desi cows. It is believed that A2 milk is safe to consume for infants as well, who have very sensitive digestive systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A lot of discussions is on these days- Which milk is better to give to our kids, A1 milk or A2 milk?</p>



<p>First, let’s figure out what is the difference between the two types of milk. A1 milk, which is the most commonly used milk and is abundantly available, is obtained from cows of Western origin like Holstein, Jersey etc. and yields a large quantity of milk. The A2 milk is the milk obtained by the cows of Indian origin like Gir, Sahiwal etc.</p>



<p>Although the source of the two milks is Cow, the two milks vary considerably in terms of the chemical composition of each. Lactose, the carbohydrate component of the milk is of different composition in both. However, it’s the protein component – casein, which is the most important deciding factor. The breakdown part of casein from A1 milk release Histidine, which leads to the formation of Histamine (Causing allergic reactions) and a component of Morphine (habit-forming drug having effects on Central Nervous System). As a result of these, the kids tend to develop allergic dermatitis (allergy on the skin), allergic rhinitis (running nose) allergic cough and asthma. Learning ability is affected by Neuro disorders like cognitive disorders and aggravated symptoms of Autism, are also caused by A1 milk, because of the presence of Morphine. The kids’ immunity is reduced, and lipid metabolism can be affected, leading to obesity and diabetes. Morphine causes constipation. Moreover, lactose intolerance is high with A1 milk.</p>



<p>It has been observed that these symptoms subside with minimum medication, once the A1 milk is discontinued in kids with such symptoms. Such kids also show an inadequate response to medication if the milk is continued to be given to them. A2 milk, on the other hand, releases energy on the breakdown of its protein component – Proline.</p>



<p>“Chromatography by Ion Exchange” is an effective method to determine if the milk is A1 or A2, because of the difference of the protein in the two kinds of milk.</p>



<p>99.9% milk available in the market is A1 milk. Milk being promoted as A2 milk may be a combination of A1 &amp; A2 milk as well. Organic milk may also be A1 milk. Other sources of A2 milk- Buffalo, goat, camel, donkey, horse, sheep etc The above points clearly indicate that A2 milk is a better and healthier option to be given to kids in comparison to A1 Milk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exploring the Phenomenon and Potential Benefits</p>



<p>Introduction:</p>



<p>In our quest for healthier food choices and improved well-being, we often come across intriguing dietary trends. One such phenomenon that has been garnering attention in recent years is “A2 milk.” Promising to be a unique and potentially beneficial alternative to conventional dairy, A2 milk has captured the curiosity of health-conscious individuals and lactose-sensitive consumers alike. In this blog post, we’ll take a personal journey into the world of A2 milk, exploring its origins, composition, and the potential benefits it may offer.</p>



<p>A2 Milk – Back to Basics:</p>



<p>Milk has been an integral part of human nutrition for centuries, providing essential nutrients and sustaining generations. Traditionally, all cows produced milk containing the A2 beta-casein protein. However, due to genetic mutations, modern-day dairy cows now produce milk with both A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins.</p>



<p>The A2 milk concept emerged from the discovery that A1 beta-casein protein can break down in the digestive system to form a peptide called beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7). Some studies have suggested that BCM-7 may lead to digestive discomfort in some individuals. This revelation sparked interest in the potential benefits of reverting to the original A2-only milk.</p>



<p>The Road to A2 Milk:</p>



<p>My own journey into the world of A2 milk began when I noticed that consuming regular dairy often left me feeling bloated and uncomfortable. A friend mentioned A2 milk as a possible solution, and my curiosity piqued. As I delved deeper into the topic, I discovered that some dairy companies and farmers have started breeding A2-dominant cows, offering a fresh perspective on dairy consumption.</p>



<p>Exploring Potential Benefits:</p>



<p>While the science surrounding A2 milk is still evolving, there have been claims of potential benefits associated with its consumption. Many consumers have reported improved digestion, reduced bloating, and increased comfort compared to traditional A1 milk. However, it is essential to approach these claims with a balanced mindset, understanding that individual responses to milk proteins can vary widely.</p>



<p>Research and Controversy:</p>



<p>As with any emerging dietary trend, the scientific community remains divided over the significance of A2 milk. Some studies have supported the potential benefits, while others have not found substantial evidence to differentiate between A1 and A2 milk. While it can be tempting to get carried away by anecdotal success stories, it’s crucial to rely on well-conducted clinical trials for more robust conclusions.</p>



<p>Embracing A2 Milk Responsibly:</p>



<p>My personal experience with A2 milk has been positive. I find that it sits better in my stomach, and I enjoy a glass of milk without the lingering discomfort. However, I am mindful of not promoting it as a universal solution. Like any dietary change, it’s essential to listen to our bodies, consult healthcare professionals if needed, and make informed choices based on our unique health needs.</p>



<p>Conclusion:</p>



<p>The unveiling of A2 milk has undoubtedly added a fresh dimension to the world of dairy consumption. As we continue to explore its potential benefits, it’s essential to approach the subject with an open mind and a critical eye. A2 milk might be a game-changer for some, while others may find little difference from conventional milk.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the choice to embrace A2 milk or stick with traditional dairy is a personal one, influenced by our health, preferences, and beliefs. As we navigate the vast landscape of nutrition, let’s remember that moderation, balance, and mindful eating form the foundation of a healthy diet.</p>



<p>Whether you choose to give A2 milk a try or not, may your journey towards better health and well-being be filled with knowledge, self-awareness, and joy in every food choice you make. Cheers to exploring the wonders of A2 milk and embracing a nourishing, holistic approach to our dietary adventures!</p>
